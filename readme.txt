This WordPress plugin lets you add Shortcode for a PriceWaiter® “Name Your Price” button to Posts and Pages through an icon on the visual editor.


== Description ==


PriceWaiter® is a micro merchant platform. This plugin integrates with PriceWaiter's API and allows you to add their “Name Your Price” button to Posts and Pages through a moustached icon on the visual editor. The PriceGarcon plugin is not endorsed by PriceWaiter®.


== Installation ==


Upload the PriceGarcon plugin to your blog and activate it. Goto Settings > PriceGarcon to enter your [PriceWaiter.com API key](https://www.PriceWaiter®.com/retailers/signup). Additionally, you can change the button text and color properties of the Name Your Price button.


== Screenshots ==


1. [Sign up with PriceWaiter](https://www.PriceWaiter®.com/retailers/signup). Enter your API Key in Settings > PriceGarcon.
2. Look for the moustached icon in the visual editor.
3. Enter a SKU and name for your product (description, price, and picture are optional).
4. That's it! In place of the Shortcode, visitors will see the "Name Your Price" button.


== How to use ==


1. Select the “PriceWaiter button generator” icon from the Posts/Pages visual editor. The PriceWaiter window appears.
2. A Product SKU and Name are required but the Description, Price, and Picture URL are optional. Click the Insert button.
3. PriceGarcon Shortcode is added to your Post/Page. That’s it!


== To Do ==


Instead of seeing Shortcode in the visual editor, how about a graphic that simulates the button?
